# Mod Marketing Site Tasks

## 1. Visual Identity
**Context:** Current design is safe but not distinctive. Site is becoming more structured like solution sites (Loveable, Figma, Cursor).

- Improve visual identity of marketing site
- Bring back cat mascot (??)
- Reintroduce color (moved away from it, but want it back)
- Make design more unique (current approach was practical but generic)

## 2. Usecase Demos
**Problem:** Existing CLI and web app demos are detailed but too much for cold visitors to process

**Goal:** Communicate usecases like Figma does - clear, digestible, visual

**Ideas:**
- Lighter-weight usecase previews instead of full walkthroughs
- Show what Mod enables at a glance before the how
- Move detailed CLI/web app demos deeper (not entry point)

## 3. Narrative & Foundational Tech
**Audience:** Investors AND early adopter developers

**Why it matters:** Early adopters are betting on a new product that won't be as feature-rich as established tools initially. They need to believe the direction is right - that Mod is building the future, not iterating on the old way. The foundational tech story is what gets them to bet on potential over polish.

- Communicate foundational tech/innovation that makes Mod powerful
- Balance practical usecases with foundational innovation messaging (like Sunday.ai website does with it's usecases that robot can do and how they trained robot hands with custom glove and human data)
- Create simple narrative line (needs more work - current version not clear enough):
  - Real-time change tracking, version control, and sync for local filesystem allows mod to allow agent workflows that are hard to do with today's tools like github (manual change tracking and only text file data) or linear (cloud based tool that doesn't have full context of filesystem and local changes)
  - → Coding agents with full context that can be trusted to go off and complete tasks with changes tracked with context and version control making it easier to reverse any wrong directions.  
  - → Teams collaborate on agent workflows across devices/environments

## 4. Positioning: Agent-First Tool + Collaboration Platform
**Challenge:** Make clear that Mod is agent/CLI first - like how Remotion and Git are CLI-first tools that deliver functionality making their workflows (video editing, version control) easier.

**Pattern to follow:**
- Remotion: CLI-first → makes video editing workflows easier
- Git: CLI-first → makes version control and code collaboration easier
- Mod: Agent/CLI-first → makes agent workflows and team collaboration easier

**Identity:**
- Agent/CLI first in feel
- But also a collaboration platform (like GitHub is for Git)
